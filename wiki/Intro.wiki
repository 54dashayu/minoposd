= Introduction =

minOPOSD is an add-on to the ArduCamOSD/MinimOSD-Extra project.

With this add-on you can use the MinimOSD hardware in combination with a flight control from OpenPilot like CC3D and Revo (it is not working with the older OPCC) which uses UAVTalk as communication protocol. 

It is intended as a temporary solution for the FPV guys till the OpenPilot OSD is available.

It is working with OpenPilot-RELEASE 12.10.1 and OpenPilot-RELEASE 12.10.2.

Currently not every MinimOSD panel is implemented, for example the RSSI, Efficiency and CallSign panels are missing.


This project is in beta state and using it is at your own risk.
