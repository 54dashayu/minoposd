The main add-ons to the original code can be found in the files:


UAVTalk.h

UAVTalk.ino

FlightBatt.h

FlightBatt.ino



But not to fork the two other original projects:

http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/

http://code.google.com/p/minimosd-extra/

I only uploaded the files with additional code.

You can find the changes by searching for 'JRChange' for the initial version and following the svn commits for all other versions.

Merging this changes into the original code gives you the possibility to build the hex file by your own.
