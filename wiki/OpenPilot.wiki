= Setting OpenPilot to communicate with MinimOSD =


Everything about OpenPilot can be found here: http://www.openpilot.org/

On this page you can find the info what you have to configure to use the MinimOSD with CC3D or Revo.


Over all hardware settings:

|| *Port* || *External* ||
|| FlexiPort || GPS ||
|| MainPort || Telemetry ||
|| RcvrPort || whatever you are using ||

Currently the best results for GPS were found using 38400 baud and an update rate of 5Hz.
With higher update rates the OpenPilot gets event warnings and CPU overloads!


----


For using the GPS you have to enable GPS under HWSettings OptionalModules.

It is a good idea to enable the ComUsbBridge at this stage, so you can configure your GPS using the CC3D as virtual com port later.

More info about using GPS at CC3D can be found in the OpenPilot wiki http://wiki.openpilot.org/display/Doc/GPS+Add-on

Double check if the AttitudeActual Flight Telemetry Update Period is 100ms.

To have a faster response to your RC controls you have to change the ManualControlCommand Flight Telemetry Update Period from 2000ms to 500ms.

When you have to configure your GPS you can *temporarily* configure ComBridge, but don't forget to *change it back* as shown in the first picture!

More info about using ComBridge of CC3D can be found in the OpenPilot wiki http://wiki.openpilot.org/display/Doc/Hardware+Settings#HardwareSettings-VirtualCommPortConfiguration

Set the ComUsbBridge speed to the speed your GPS is using.
