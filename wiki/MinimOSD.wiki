= MinimOSD update and config =

In the download section http://code.google.com/p/minoposd/downloads/list you can find a zipped config tool and the hex file.

After unzipping the config tool you can use this tool for updating the minOPOSD firmware and configuring the MinimOSD for your need as described here http://code.google.com/p/minimosd-extra/wiki/Config_Tool

But please remember, not every panel is currently portet 1 to 1 compared to MinimOSD-Extra.
