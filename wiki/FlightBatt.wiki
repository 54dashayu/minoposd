= FlightBatt measurements on MinimOSD =

Measuring the FlightBatt voltage there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD.

Measuring the FlightBatt ampere there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD and you have to buy a current sensor.

How to do these things will follow on this wiki page.

As a little preview the soldering for measuring the FlightBatt voltage is shown here:

It is a voltage divider using the following parts:

|| *count* || *type* || *value* || *precision* ||
|| 1 || resistor || 16.0 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || resistor || 1.1 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || capacitor || 100nF ||  ||
