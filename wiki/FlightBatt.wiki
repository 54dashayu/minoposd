= FlightBatt measurements on MinimOSD =

For measuring the FlightBatt voltage there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD.

For measuring the FlightBatt ampere there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD and you have to use an extra current sensor.

How to do these things will follow on this wiki page.

As a little preview the soldering for measuring the FlightBatt voltage is shown here without heatshrink for clarity:

It is a voltage divider using the following parts:

|| *count* || *type* || *value* || *precision* ||
|| 1 || resistor || 16.0 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || resistor || 1.1 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || capacitor || 100 nF ||  ||
