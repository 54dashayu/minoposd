= FlightBatt measurements on MinimOSD =

For measuring the FlightBatt voltage there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD.

For measuring the FlightBatt ampere there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD and you have to use an extra current sensor.

Only do this if you have some good soldering skills, especially soldering directly at the ATmega 328p.

Also only do this if you have the knowledge of what you are doing.

If you do not have both, please wait for the OpenPilot OSD. With that, soldering is not necessary. 

Bad soldering or less knowledge can risk your aerial vehicle and even lives!

The necessary soldering for measuring the FlightBatt voltage on an 3s system is shown here without heatshrink for clarity:

and with voltage divider heatshrink:

It is a voltage divider / filter using the following parts:

|| *count* || *type* || *value* || *precision* ||
|| 1 || capacitor || 100 nF ||  ||
|| 1 || resistor || 1.1 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || resistor || 16.0 kOhm || 1% ||

The soldering for current measuring, beware of the pin assignment at the connector, it depends on the used sensor:

The current sensor needs a voltage divider, because we use the internal 1.1 V ADC reference of the ATmega 328p:

It is a voltage divider using the following parts:

|| *count* || *type* || *value* || *precision* ||
|| 1 || resistor || 1.1 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || resistor || 3.0 kOhm || 1% ||

After the soldering you have to calibrate the system.
