= FlightBatt measurements on MinimOSD =

For measuring the FlightBatt voltage there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD.

For measuring the FlightBatt ampere there is some soldering necessary on the MinimOSD and you have to use an extra current sensor.

How to do these things will follow on this wiki page.

As a little preview the necessary soldering for measuring the FlightBatt voltage is shown here without heatshrink for clarity:

and with voltage divider heatshrink:

It is a voltage divider / filter using the following parts:

|| *count* || *type* || *value* || *precision* ||
|| 1 || resistor || 16.0 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || resistor || 1.1 kOhm || 1% ||
|| 1 || capacitor || 100 nF ||  ||

The current measurement is not testet yet!

Details will follow.
